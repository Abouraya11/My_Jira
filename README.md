# 3) Possible Stakeholders
* I will represent the possible stakeholders by Stakeholders Matrix

| -----------     | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------       |
| Mats John       | Stakeholder | High        | High        | Actively engaged |

# 4) First sprint Near vision
* Our initial goal of the first sprint is to create an account page and login page after making UI designs for create account page and login page by the front-end team with intiaition and modification of Database with some insertions and security for the login page for verification by Two-factor authentication. Furthermore, show all the available products in the homepage from the database as well as making a categorized cart

# 5) Second sprint Near vision
* Our initial goal of the second sprint is to add the selected items are to the cart and user can modify his cart at any time. Also checking offers to be made. Finally, All Payment methods to be done (Fawry, Visa and Apple pay) with their error handling in case of entering wrong data.

# 6) Rationale Product Backlog Order
We have to epics the first one is **Database Development with verification** and the second one is **Payment and Cart**, They are ordered like this because we need to develop the database with its dependents such as login then after that we can focus on the payment methods and cart.

* In the first Epic: The order start with the PBIs that have high buisness value to customer, We started with Database Development PBI then Database modifications PBI as the database is the heart of our online shopping system because all the next items in the backlog definitly depend on the database such as create account PBI which store the account created in the database then login which should come after create an account and need to compare the data written in the login with the stored ones in the database. After that we put The Two-factor authentication item due to the dependency of this item on login. After all these PBIs, We put the show available products PBI as it get the available products from the database and require the user to be logged in first.

* In the second Epic:  The first PBI we put is Categorized Cart beacuse this is the most important PBI in this epic because all the PBIs after it depend totally on it so we put after that the Add to cart PBI to add items then we put Modify Cart to be abl to modify the items added to cart. After that we put Check offers PBI thenwe start putting the payment options PBIs such that Visa Payment PBI then Visa payment Rejection PBI to reject any payment if wrong Visa data is added. Moreover, we put the Fawry payment PBI then Fawry Payment Rejection PBI in case of adding wrong Fawry number, Error handling of each payment method should be implemented after each payment method of them then we put Apple Pay PBI. Additionally, The print Reciept PBI is added because it should be printed after payment process is finished it is considered the last step in payment. Finally, We put the order notification PBI to notify the user whether the order placed succeffully or not as a final step.

# 7) Estimate how many story points can your team achieve per sprint

* 50 story points/sprint

# 8) Clearly indicate your rationale and Rules used in the workflow 
* Rationale:  When a sprint is started the PBI enter TODO state the it is moved to in-progress state when start developing the PBI then it is moved to Code Quality Review state if there is no impediments occur. How ever if an impediment occur the PBI go to Pause progress state where the scrum master and the team solve this impediment then the PBI go back to in progress state back and continoue to Code Quality Review state where if the code is rejected the PBI returns back to in-progess state else it goes to done state where it is considered as done there. 

* Rules: The first rule to be used is **Assign an issue to someone** for example the issue which (from progress to code review) is assigned to Testers from the testing team such as Sabrina and julia. Moreover, the second rule to be used is **Restrict who can move an issue** to make sure any PBI that is in Code Quality Review state is passed to in-progress or Done state under approval of Testing team members (Sabrina, Julia, Tam and gabi) only (Restricted).
